<strong>Citizens' Pulse Mobile App</strong>

<strong>Concept:</strong>
The idea of Citizens’ Pulse comes from a need to contain and help predict COVID-19 while protecting an individual's privacy. View PJ Moskal’s video in which he explains the concept and presents the prototype of the app: http://www.laksom.com/edu_pulse.html

The idea of collecting anonymous data about a specific issue in this case the well-being of the user of the app can be used beyond the COVID-19 epidemic in the future. Citizens’ Pulse could take a pulse of a nation or region as it makes important decisions about the direction of a country such as electing officials, making major policy decisions. It’s about time that the citizens’ instead of allowing for corporate or governmental surveillance provide information to their governments in a transparent fashion with full control over the content that is being transferred.

<strong>Open source:</strong>

The best way to ensure that the system is respecting users’ privacy and is widely available is to develop it as a community, as an open source application.

<strong>Volunteers:</strong>
The project relies solely on volunteers to develop the application and spread the word of the app idea to general public, health experts, governmental officials.
